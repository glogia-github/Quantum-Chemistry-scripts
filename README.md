# DFT calculations and visualization
The tcl scripts help load data into VMD (multiple xyz files with premade representations) and extract it (automated renderings in high resolution, selections of data points using VMD internal selections). 

In order to select between molecules a dummy atom must be inserted from the starting molecule into the target molecules xyz.
